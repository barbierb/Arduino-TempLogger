# Arduino-TempLogger

**TempLogger** is a C++ program meant to be run on Arduino WeMos D1 R1, but can also be any esp8266 compatible boards. This program does send every x seconds temperature and humidity to a google spreadsheet. Temperature and humidity is obtained with a simple DHT22 sensor.

## 🚊 Usage
> Make sure the DHT22 is plugged like in diagrams
> Power up the board and it will starts to send the data online.

> If the data does not updates, you will need to start the Arduino IDE on your computer and check the Serial logs through USB.
